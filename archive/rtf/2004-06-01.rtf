here you want to be, keep reading.This document includes a series of numbered rules followed by a glossary. Many of the numbered rules are divided into subrules, and each separate rule and subrule of the game has its own number. Words or phrases in }{\i

We at Wizards of the Coast recognize that no matter how detailed the rules
, situations will arise in which the interaction of specific cards requires a precise answer. If you have questions, you can get the answers from us. Contact information is on the last page of this rulebook.}{\i

408.1a Spells and abilities can be played only at certain times and follow a set of rules for doing so.
\par 
\par 408.1b Spells and activated abilities are played by players (if th
ey choose) using a system of priority, while other types of abilities and effects are automatically generated by the game rules. Each time a player would get priority, all applicable state-based effects resolve first as a single event (see rule 420, \'93
State-Based Effects\'94
). Then, if any new state-based effects have been generated, they resolve as a single event. This process repeats until no more applicable state-based effects are generated. Then triggered abilities are added to the stack (see rule 410, \'93Han
dling Triggered Abilities\'94
). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based effects or triggered abilities are generated. Then the player who would have received priority does so and may play a spell, ability, or land as governed by the rules for
 that phase. The game also checks for state-based effects and triggered abilities during the cleanup step (see rule 314, \'93Cleanup Step\'94). If any state-based effects resolve or abilities trigger, the active player gets priority afterward.
\par 
\par 408.1c The active
 player gets priority at the beginning of most phases and steps, after special actions and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step go on the stack. (The exceptions are the untap step and the cleanup step.) The active player also gets
 
priority after combat damage resolves. The player with priority may either play a spell or ability, or pass. If he or she plays a spell or ability, the player again receives priority; otherwise, his or her opponent receives priority. If both players pass 
i
n succession (that is, if both players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the top spell or ability on the stack resolves, then the active player receives priority. If the stack is empty when both players pass in succession, the phase or 
step ends and the next one begins.
\par 
\par 408.1d A player may play a spell or activated ability only when he or she has priority. Spells other than instants can be played only during a player\rquote s main phase, when that player has priority, and only when the stack is empty.
\par

 The source is chosen when the spell or ability resolves. If an effect requires a player to choose a source, he or she may choose either a permanent or a spell on the stack (including one that creates a permanent) or any card or permanent referred to by a
 spell or pseudospell on the stack. If the player chooses a permanent or a permanent spell, the prevention will apply to the next damage from that permanent or the permanent resulting from the spell, regardless of whether it\rquote 
s from one of that permanent\rquote s abilities or combat damage dealt by it. It\rquote s possible for the source to be out of play by the time the spell or ability resolves.\line 
     Some abilities that generate prevention effects can affect damage only from a source with certain characteristics, such as a creature or a source of a particular color. When the chosen source would deal damage, a prevention \'93shield\'94
 with this type of restriction rechecks the source\rquote s characteristics. If the characteristics no longer match, the damage isn\rquote t prevented. If for any reason the shield prevents no damage, the shield isn\rquote t used up.

\par Damage
\par Many spells and abilities deal damage to creatures and/or players. Creatures may also deal combat damage during the combat phase.
\par      Damage dealt to a player is subtracted from his or her life total.
\par      Damage dealt to a creature stays on the permanent, even if it stops being a creature. A creature with damage greater than or equal to its toughness (and greater than 0) has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed. (See rule 420, \'93
State-Based Effects.\'94) Damage doesn\rquote t alter a creature\rquote s toughness. A noncreature permanent isn\rquote 
t affected by damage (but if it becomes a creature again before the damage is removed, the creature may be destroyed). During the cleanup step, all damage is removed from permanents.
\par      Costs and effects that read \'93lose life\'94 or \'93pay life\'94 don\rquote t deal damage, and that loss of life can\rquote t be prevented or otherwise altered by damage-prevention effects.

\par Damage-Prevention Ability
\par A damage-prevention ability is a static or activated ability that generates a damage-prevention effect. See rule 419.7, \'93Prevention Effects.\'94
\par 
\par Deck
\par A player\rquote s deck is the collection of cards that player starts the game with. When the game begins, each player\rquote s deck becomes his or her library.

\par Defending Player
\par During the combat phase, the active player\rquote 
s opponent is the defending player. (In a multiplayer game, there may be one defending player at a time or there may be more than one, depending on which variant is being played.) Creatures can attack only the defending player; they can\rquote

 have the default abilities of both basic land types and are treated as both by all spells and abilities that specifically refer to those types. However, they are not basic lands. A dual land card doesn\rquote t count as two lands while in play\emdash it

A permanent leaves play when it moves from the in-play zone to any other zone. See rule 410.10c.     If a token leaves play, it ceases to exist. This is a state-based effect.     If a card leaves play and later returns, it\rquote

Legend is a special creature type. Legendary is a supertype that may apply to any type (\'93Legendary Land,\'94 \'93Legendary Artifact,\'94 and so on).     If two or more Legends or legendary permanents with the same
 name are in play, all except the one that has been a Legend or legendary permanent with that name the longest are put into their owners\rquote  graveyards. This \'93Legend rule\'94 is a state-based effect.
     A Legend that stops being a creature is still legendary, and a legendary permanent that becomes a creature gets the creature type Legend in addition to any other creature type it may have.
     A Legend that changes creature type to a creature type other than Legend is no longer a Legend and is no longer subject to the Legend rule. A creature that changes creature type to Legend is now a Legend and is subject to the Legend rule.
Lethal DamageLethal damage is an amount of damage greater than 0 and greater than or equal to a creature\rquote s toughness. A creature with lethal damage is destroyed. This is a state-based effect.Library

\par Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. The phrase \'93Madness [cost]\'94 means \'93If a player would discard this card from his or her hand, that player discards it, but may remove it from the game instead 
of putting it into his or her graveyard\'94 and \'93
When this card is removed from the game this way, until that player passes next, the player may play it any time he or she could play an instant as though it were in his or her hand by paying [cost] rather than
 paying its mana cost. When the player passes next, he or she puts it into his or her graveyard.\'94 See rule 502.24, \'93Madness.\'94
\par Main PhaseThe term \'93main phase\'94 comprises the first main and second main phases, also called the \'93precombat\'94 and \'93postcombat\'94 ma
in phases. Artifact, creature, enchantment, and sorcery spells may be played only by the active player during his or her main phase, and only when the stack is empty. A player may also play one land each turn during his or her main phase.ManaMana is the
 energy used to play spells and it\rquote s usually produced by lands. Mana is created by mana abilities (and sometimes by spells), and it can be used to pay costs immediately or can go into the player\rquote s mana pool.
     Colored mana costs, represented by colored mana symbols, can be paid only with the appropriate color of mana. Generic mana costs can be paid with any color of, or with colorless, mana.
     Specialized types of mana can exist. For example, an ability might produce mana that can be used only to play creature spells or only to pay activation costs.
\par      The type of mana a permanent \'93could produce\'94 is the type of mana that any ability of that permanent can generate, taking into account any applicable replacement effects. The amount of mana is irrelevant (even if it\rquote 
s 0); only the type matters. If the type of mana can\rquote t be defined, there\rquote s no type of mana that that permanent could produce.
\par      The \'93type\'94 of mana includes both its color (if any) and any restrictions placed upon it (for example, mana that can be used only to play artifact spells).Mana Ability
This is an ability category. A mana ability is either activated or triggered. A mana ability doesn\rquote t go on the stack\emdash it resolves immediately.     A player may play a mana ability whenever he or she
 has priority and whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment. This is the only type of ability that can be played in the middle of playing or resolving a spell or ability. See rule 406.1, \'93Mana Abilities.\'94Mana Burn
When a phase ends, any unused mana remaining in a player\rquote s mana pool is lost. The player loses 1 life for each mana lost this way. This is called \'93mana burn.\'94Mana Cost
The mana cost of a nonland card is indicated by the mana symbols printed on its upper right corner. The mana cost of a land card, token, or face-down creature is 0. See rule 203, \'93Mana Cost.\'94Mana PoolWhen a spell or ability creates mana that\rquote 
s not used immediately to pay a cost, the mana is stored in the mana pool, an imaginary area. From there, it can be used to pay for spells and abilities. The mana pool is cleared at the end of each phase. }{\i\f28\fs22 See also}{\f28\fs22  Mana Burn.
Mana Source (Obsolete)Earlier versions of the rules provided support for the \'93mana source\'94 spell type. All mana source cards are now instant cards. Abilities that read \'93Play this ability as a mana source\'94 are now mana abilities.Mana Symbol
The mana symbols are W, U, B, R, G, 0, numerals, X, and Y.     Each of the colored mana symbols represents one colored mana: W white, U blue, B black, R red, and G green.
     Numeral symbols (such as 1) are generic mana costs and represent an amount of mana that can be paid with any color of, or colorless, mana.     The symbols X and Y represent unspecified amounts of mana; when playing a spell or activated ability with X
 or Y in its cost, its controller decides the value of that variable. 
\par      Numeral symbols, X, and Y can also represent colorless mana if they appear in the effect of a spell or of a mana ability that reads \'93add [mana symbol] to your mana pool\'94 or something similar.
     The symbol 0 represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder when a spell or activated ability costs nothing to play. A spell or ability whose cost is 0 must still be played the same way as one with a cost greater than zero; it won\rquote t pla
y itself automatically.MatchA match is a series of }{\b\f28\fs22 Magic}{\f28\fs22

A spell is modal if it offers a choice of effects. Its controller must choose the mode as part of playing the spell. On current cards, modal spells are always written \'93Choose one \emdash \'94 or \'93[a specified player] chooses one \emdash .\'94 
Mono Artifact (Obsolete)Earlier versions of the rules provided support for the \'93mono artifact\'94 card type. All mono artifact cards are now simp
ly artifact cards. Artifacts printed with the mono artifact card type generally have the tap symbol in their activation cost. If there is none printed, \'93tap\'94 must be added to the printed cost.
\par Morph
\par Morph is a static ability that functions any time you could play the card it\rquote s on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. The phrase \'93Morph [cost]\'94 means \'93
You may play this card as a 2/2 face-down creature, with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion symbol, and a mana cost of 0 by paying 3 rather than its mana cost.\'94
 Any time you could play an instant, you may show all players the morph cost for any face-down permanent you control, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. This action does not use the stack. See rule 502.26, \'93Morph.\'94

 a local enchantment or a counter from one permanent to another. If the enchantment or counter no longer exists or the new permanent is no longer in play when the spell or ability resolves, nothing happens. Similarly, an enchantment can\rquote 
t be moved onto a permanent it couldn\rquote t enchant; if this kind of move is attempted, the enchantment stays where it was.     A moved enchantment stops en
chanting the previous permanent and starts enchanting the new one, and it receives a new timestamp. Nothing else about the enchantment changes. The enchantment never left play, so no comes-into-play or leaves-play triggered abilities will trigger. If an a

into his or her library and drawing a new hand with one fewer card before taking the first turn. Any player dissatisfied with his or her starting hand may mulligan as often as he or she wishes, drawing one fewer card each time. See rule 101.5.Multicolored
A multicolored card has two or more colors. Multicolored cards are printed with gold frames to reinforce this.     A multicolored permanent is affected by anything that singles out any of its colors. For example, a black-and-green creature is destroyed 
by a spell that reads, \'93Destroy all green creatures.\'94 Something that can\rquote t affect a particular color doesn\rquote t affect a multicolored permanent with that color, so that same creature can\rquote

Any land with a name other than Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest (or Snow-Covered Plains, and so on) is nonbasic. A nonbasic land that is a basic land type has that land\rquote

\par Pay
\par Playing most spells and activated abilities requires paying costs.
\par      Paying mana is done by removing the indicated amount of mana from the player\rquote s mana pool. Any time a player is asked to pay mana, mana abilities may be played. Paying life subtracts the indicated amount of life from the player\rquote 
s life total. A player can\rquote t pay more mana than the amount of mana in his or her mana pool or more life than his or her life total. Zero life or zero mana can always be paid.
\par      To pay any cost, the player carries out the instructions specified in the card\rquote s rules text. It\rquote s illegal to attempt paying a cost when unable to successfully follow the instructions. For example, a player can\rquote 
t pay a cost that requires tapping a creature if that creature is already tapped.
\par      Each payment applies to only one spell or ability. For example, a player can\rquote t sacrifice just one creature to play the activated a
bilities of two permanents that require sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn\rquote t pay another spell or ability\rquote s cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.

\par A spell or ability goes on top of the stack when it\rquote 
s played or triggered. Combat-damage assignments also go on top of the stack as though they were a single pseudospell. Whenever both players pass in succession, the spell, ability, or combat damage on top of
 the stack resolves and the active player receives priority again. See rule 217.6, \'93Stack,\'94 and rule 408.1, \'93Timing, Priority, and the Stack.\'94

\par State triggers are triggered abilities that watch for a game state rather than an event and trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. Once a state trigger has triggered, it won\rquote

Static abilities do something all the time rather than being played at specific times
. Static abilities create continuous effects, which are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains in play and has the ability, or as long as the card with the ability remains in the appropriate zone. A spell or ability can also create a con
tinuous effect that doesn\rquote t depend on a permanent; these may last a specified length of time or for the rest of the game. See rule 412, \'93Handling Static Abilities.\'94

\par Earlier versions of the rules provided support for \'93successfully cast\'94 as a step in the announcement and resolution of a spell or ability. In general, any ability that\rquote s written as triggering when a spell is \'93successfully cast\'94
 should be read as triggering when the spell is played.

\par Older creature cards were printed with the type \'93Summon [creature subtype].\'94 All \'93Summon [creature subtype]\'94 cards should be read as \'93Creature \emdash  [creature subtype].\'94
\par 
\par Summoning Sickness (Obsolete)
\par In earlier versions of the rules, the term \'93summoning sickness\'94 was used to describe a creature\rquote s inability to attack or to use activated abilities that include the tap symbol when it has come under a player\rquote

\par Text Box
\par The text box is printed below the illustration on a }{\b\f28\fs22 Magic}{\f28\fs22  card and contains rules, reminder text, and flavor text.
\par 
\par }{\f28\fs22\cf1 Threshold
\par Threshold is a static ability. A card with threshold has the text after \'93Threshold \emdash \'94 if its controller has seven or more cards in his or her graveyard. Otherwise, the text after \'93Threshold \emdash \'94
 is treated as though it did not appear on the card. An instant or sorcery card with threshold has the threshold text only if the card is on the stack. An artifact, creature, enchantment, or land card with thresho
ld, or any permanent with threshold, has the threshold text only if the card or permanent is in play.}{\f28\fs22  See rule 502.23, \'93Threshold.\'94
\par 
\par Tie
\par If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie. The }{\b\f28\fs22 Magic}{\f28\fs22  game has no default for ties.
\par 
\par Timestamp Order
\par A card or permanent\rquote s timestamp is the time it entered the zone it\rquote s currently in, with two exceptions: (1) If two or more cards or permanents enter a zone simultaneously, the ac
tive player determines their timestamp order at the time they enter that zone, but a local enchantment must be timestamped after what it enchants. (2) Whenever a local enchantment becomes attached to a permanent, the enchantment receives a new timestamp.

\par  
    Continuous effects generated by static abilities have the same timestamp as the card or permanent that generated them. Continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability receive a timestamp when the spell or ability creating them res
olves.

A token is an object in play representing a noncard permanent created by a spell or ability. Tokens can be tapped and untapped just like cards, though an alternative to rotation might be needed to distinguish their status. See rule 216, \'93Tokens.\'94

\par A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many }{\i\f28\fs22 Odyssey }{\f28\fs22 block cards with abilities that are relevant in a player\rquote s graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when they\rquote 
re in a graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play.
\par 
\par Total Casting Cost (Obsolete)
\par Some older cards were printed with the term \'93total casting cost\'94 to describe the converted mana cost of a spell. In general, cards that were printed with the term \'93total casting cost\'94 now use the term \'93converted mana cost.\'94
\par 
\par Toughness
\par The number after the slash printed on the lower right corner of a creature card is the creature\rquote s toughness. A creature\rquote s current toughness is the initial value (the printed number), modified by any counters that adjust tou
ghness and then by any continuous effects.
\par      A creature that\rquote s been dealt damage greater than or equal to its toughness (and greater than 0) has lethal damage and will be destroyed the next time any player would receive priority. This is a state-based effect.
\par      A few creature cards have toughness represented by * instead of a number. This signifies that the creature has a static ability that sets its toughness according to some stated condition. If a spell or ability attempts to read the toughness whe
n the creature card isn\rquote t in play, the * is equal to 0.

Trample is a static ability modifying the combat damage step of the combat phase. It lets an attacking creature \'93trample over\'94 blocking creatures and assign part of its combat damage to the defending player. See rule 502.9, \'93Trample.\'94

\par Trigger, Triggered Ability
\par A triggered ability begins with the word \'93when,\'94 \'93whenever,\'94 or \'93at.\'94 Whenever the trigger event occurs, the ability goes on top of the stack the next time a player would receive priority. See rule 404, \'93Triggered Abilities.\'94

\par 
\par Type
\par The word \'93type\'94 by itself is ambiguous\emdash it may mean the basic type of a card, spell, and so on, or the subtype of a creature, enchantment, or land. See rules 212\endash 215.
\par      A card\rquote s type (and subtype, if applicable) is printed directly below the illustration on the card. The spell type for a nonland card is the same as its card type, even if its rules text states it can be played \'93as\'94
 some other type (that is, following the timing rules for playing that other type). The permanent type for a card in play is the same as its card type. Tokens have no card or spell type but do have a permanent type.
\par      When a spell or ability changes a permanent\rquote s type, the new type replaces all previous types. If the spell or ability is adding a type, it will say so.
\par      A creature\rquote s type is printed after the word \'93creature\'94 below the illustration on the card or is defined by the spell or ability that created a token. A creature may have multiple types. A noncreature card that\rquote s c
hanged into a creature by a spell or ability has no creature type unless the spell or ability gives it one.
\par      A land\rquote s type is the same as its name.
\par      A local enchantment\rquote s type is printed after the word \'93Enchant\'94 on the card\rquote s type line.
\par      Categories of cards, such as basic land or local enchantment, aren\rquote t types or subtypes and can\rquote t be named when a type must be chosen.
\par      The \'93type\'94 of mana includes both its color (if any) and any restrictions placed upon it (for example, mana that can be used only to play artifact spells).
\par 
\par Unblockable
\par If an attacking creature \'93is unblockable,\'94 no creature can legally block it. Spells or abilities may still cause it to become blocked.
\par 
\par Unblocked Creature
\par An attacking creature becomes an unblocked creature during the declare blockers step of the combat phase if no creature blocks it. It remains an unblocked creature until a spell or ability causes it to become blocked, it\rquote 
s removed from combat, it stops being a creature, its controller changes, or the combat phase ends. Unblocked creatures don\rquote t exist outside of the combat phase or before the declare blockers step. See rule 309, \'93Declare Blockers Step.\'94
\par 
\par Unless
\par Some cards use the phrase \'93[Do something] unless you [do something else].\'94 This means the same thing as \'93You may [do something else]. If you don\rquote t, [do something].\'94
\par 
\par Untap
\par 1. To untap a tapped card, rotate it back to the upright position. }{\i\f28\fs22 See also}{\f28\fs22  Tap.
\par 2. Untap is the first step of the beginning phase of the turn. All permanents controlled by the active player normally untap at this time. See rule 302, \'93Untap Step.\'94
\par 
\par Upkeep
\par Upkeep is the second step of the beginning phase of the turn. Some cards have abilities that trigger at the beginning of the upkeep step; such an ability is called an \'93upkeep cos}{\f28\fs22\expnd4\expndtw20 t}{\f28\fs22 \'94 or an \'93upkeep effect.
\'94 An upkeep cost is usually written in the form \'93At the beginning of your upkeep, you may [pay cost]. If you don\rquote t, sacrifice [this card].\'94 See rule 303, \'93Upkeep Step.\'94
\par 
\par }{\i\f28\fs22 Vanguard}{\f28\fs22  Card
\par The }{\i\f28\fs22 Vanguard\'99}{\f28\fs22  supplements consist of oversized cards that modify the game. A }{\i\f28\fs22 Vanguard}{\f28\fs22  card is selected before the game begins, adjusting a player\rquote 
s starting and maximum hand size and starting life total. Any abilities printed on a }{\i\f28\fs22 Vanguard}{\f28\fs22  card are played exactly like those of an in-play }{\b\f28\fs22 Magic}{\f28\fs22 
 card; however, these abilities have no color, and damage from them isn\rquote t damage from a permanent of any type or a source of any color. A }{\i\f28\fs22 Vanguard}{\f28\fs22  card isn\rquote t a }{\b\f28\fs22 Magic}{\f28\fs22  card, so it can\rquote 
t be affected by spells or abilities.
\par 
\par Wall
\par A Wall is a type of creature that can\rquote t be declared as an attacker. In all other respects, a Wall is the same as any other creature.
\par 
\par X
\par If a cost has an \'93X\'94 in it, the value of X must be announced as part of playing the spell or ability. (See rule 409, \'93Playing Spells and Abilities.\'94
) While the spell or ability is on the stack, the X in its mana cost equals that amount of generic mana. If a card in any other zone has X in its mana cost, the amount is treated as 0. If you\rquote re playing a spell without paying its 
mana cost and that spell has X in its mana cost, X is 0.
\par      In triggered abilities, X is defined when the ability resolves. It may be defined by the text of the ability, by a keyword ability of the card, or by the trigger event.
\par      In other cases, X is defined by the text of a spell or ability. If X isn\rquote t defined, the controller of the spell or ability chooses the value of X. All Xs on a card have the same value.
\par 
\par Y, Z
\par }{\i\f28\fs22 See}{\f28\fs22  X.
\par 
\par Yield Priority (Obsolete)
\par In earlier versions of the rules, the term \'93yield priority\'94 was used instead of \'93pass.\'94
\par 
\par You, Your
\par The words \'93you\'94 and \'93your\'94 on a card or permanent refer to the spell or ability\rquote s controller. For static abilities, this is the current controller of the card or permanent (or the card\rquote s owner if it isn\rquote t in 
play). For activated abilities, this is the player who played the ability. For triggered abilities, this is the controller of the card when the ability triggered (or the card\rquote s owner if it wasn\rquote t in play).
\par 
\par Zone
\par A zone is any place that }{\b\f28\fs22 Magic }{\f28\fs22 cards can be during a game. See rule 217, \'93Zones.\'94}{\f28
