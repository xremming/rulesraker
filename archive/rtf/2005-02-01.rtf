\rquote re looking for, check the glossary.

tructed deck can have any number of basic land cards and no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards.

\par 101.1. At the start of a game, each player shuffles his or her own deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle his or her opponent\rquote s deck. The players\rquote  decks become their libraries.
\par 
\par 101.2. After the decks have been shuffled, the players determine who chooses which player goes first using any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.). In a match of several games, the loser of t
he previous game decides who will take the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the person who determined who would take the first turn in the previous game decides.
\par 
\par 101.3. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets his or her life total to 20 and draws a hand of seven cards.
\par 
\par 101.4. A player who is dissatisfied with his or her initial hand may mulligan. First, the starting player takes any mulligans. To take a mulligan, that player shuffles his or her hand back into the deck an
d then draws a new hand of six cards. He or she may repeat this process as many times as desired, drawing one fewer card each time, until the hand size reaches zero cards. Once the starting player has decided to keep a hand, the other player may take any 
number of mulligans. A player can\rquote t take any mulligans once he or she has decided to keep a hand.
\par 
\par 101.5. Once both players are satisfied with their hands, the starting player takes his or her turn. The player who plays first skips the draw step (see rule 304, \'93Draw Step\'94) of his or her first turn.

\par 402.1. An ability is text on an object that\rquote s not reminder text or flavor text (see rule 400.1). The result of following such an instruction is an effect. (See rule 416, \'93Effects.\'94) Abilities can affect the objects they\rquote 
re on; they can also affect other objects and/or players. Abilities can grant abilities to other objects or to the objects they\rquote re on; they do so when the words \'93has,\'94 \'93have,\'94 \'93gains,\'94 or \'93gain\'94 are used.
\par 
\par 402.2. There are three general categories of abilities: activated, triggered, and static. Activated and triggered abilities can also be mana abilities. Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effect
s. Some effects are replacement effects or prevention effects.
\par 
\par 402.3. Abilities can be beneficial or detrimental. For example, \'93[This creature] can\rquote t block\'94 is an ability.
\par 
\par 402.4. An additional cost or alternative cost to play a card is an ability of the card.
\par 
\par 402.5. An ability isn\rquote t a spell and therefore can\rquote t be countered by anything that counters only spells. Abilities can be countered by effects that specifically counter
 abilities, as well as by the rules (for example, an ability with one or more targets is countered if all its targets become illegal).
\par 
\par 402.6. Once activated or triggered, an ability exists independently of its source as an ability on the stack. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won\rquote 
t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, \'93Prodigal Sorcerer deals 1 damage to target creature or player\'94) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In 
these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source will check that information when the ability resolves, or will use the source\rquote s last known information if it\rquote s no longer in play.
\par 
\par 402.7. An object may have multiple abilities. Aside from certain defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule 502, \'93Keyword Abilities\'94), each paragraph break in a card\rquote 
s text marks a separate ability. An object may also have multiple instances of the same ability. Each instance functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the specific ability for more information.

\par 
\par 402.8. Abilities function only while the permanent with the ability is in play unless the abil
ity is a characteristic-setting ability that sets type or color, an ability of an instant or sorcery, an additional cost, an alternative cost, or a play restriction. Abilities can also function in other zones if they state otherwise or if the ability can 
only trigger or be played in a zone other than the in-play zone. An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object it\rquote s on out of a particular zone functions only in that zone.

408.1a Spells and activated abilities can be played only at certain times and follow a set of rules for doing so.
\par 
\par 408.1b Spells and activated abilities are played by players (if they choose) using a system of priority, while other types of abilities and e
ffects are automatically generated by the game rules. Each time a player would get priority, all applicable state-based effects resolve first as a single event (see rule 420, \'93State-Based Effects\'94
). Then, if any new state-based effects have been generated, they resolve as a single event. This process repeats until no more applicable state-based effects are generated. Then triggered abilities are added to the stack (see rule 410, \'93
Handling Triggered Abilities\'94). These steps repeat in order until no further s
tate-based effects or triggered abilities are generated. Then the player who would have received priority does so and may play a spell or ability, take a special action (such as playing a land), or pass, as governed by the rules for that phase or step.

\par 
\par 40
8.1c The active player gets priority at the beginning of most phases and steps, after any game actions are dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step go on the stack. No player gets priority during the untap step and play
ers usually don\rquote 
t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 314.3). The player with priority may either play a spell or ability, take a special action, or pass. If he or she plays a spell or ability, or takes a special action, the player again receives
 priority; otherwise, his or her opponent receives priority. If both players pass in succession (that is, if both players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active player receives priority. 
If the stack is empty when both players pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.
\par 
\par 408.1d A player may play a spell or activated ability only when he or she has priority. Spells other than instants can be played only during a player\rquote s main phase, when that player has priority and the stack is empty.
\par 
\par 408.1e When a spell is played, it goes on top of the stack. When an activated ability is played, it goes on top of the stack.
\par 
\par 408.1f Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, includ
ing during the playing or resolution of a spell or another ability. However, nothing actually happens at the time the abilities trigger. Each time a player would receive priority, each ability that has triggered is put on the stack (if it hasn\rquote 
t already been put on the stack). Then the player gets priority and may play spells or abilities. (See rule 410, \'93Handling Triggered Abilities.\'94)
