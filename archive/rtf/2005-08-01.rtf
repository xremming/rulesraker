A turn consists of five phases, in this order: beginning, precombat main, combat, postcombat main, and end. Each of these phases takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase. The beginning, combat, and end phases are further broken down into steps, which proceed in order.\par \par 300.2. A phase or step ends when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession. No game events can occur between turns, phases, or steps. Simply having the stack become empty doesn\rquote t cause the phase or step to end; all players have to pass with the stack empty. Because of this, each player gets a chance to add new things to the stack before the current phase or step ends.\par \par 300.3.

When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger \ldblquote at the beginning of\rdblquote  that phase or step are added to the stack.\par \par 300.6.

Each time a player would get priority, all applicable state-based effects resolve first as a single event (see rule 420, \ldblquote State-Based Effects\rdblquote ). Then, if any new state-based effects have been generated, they resolve as a single event. This process repeats until no more applicable state-based effects are generated. Then triggered abilities are added to the stack (see rule 410, \ldblquote Handling Triggered Abilities\rdblquote ). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based effects or triggered abilities are generated. Then the player who would have received priority does so and may play a spell or ability, take a special action (such as playing a land), or pass, as governed by the rules for that phase or step.\par \par 408.1c The active player gets priority at the beginning of most phases and steps, after any game actions are dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step go on the stack. No player gets priority during the untap step and players usually don\rquote t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 314.3). The player with priority may play a spell or ability, take a special action, or pass. If he or she plays a spell or ability, or takes a special action, the player again receives priority; otherwise, the next player in turn order receives priority. If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active player receives priority. If the stack is empty when all players pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.\par \par 408.1d A player may play a spell or activated ability only when he or she has priority. Spells other than instants can be played only during a player\rquote s main phase, when that player has priority and the stack is empty.\par \par 408.1e When a spell is played, it goes on top of the stack. When an activated ability is played, it goes on top of the stack.\par \par 408.1f Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including during the playing or resolution of a spell or another ability. However, nothing actually happens at the time the abilities trigger.
