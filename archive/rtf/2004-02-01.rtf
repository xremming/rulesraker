No game events can occur between turns, phases, or steps. Simply having the stack become empty doesn\rquote t cause the phase or step to end; both players have to pass with the stack empty. Because of this, each player always gets a chance to add new things to the stack before the current phase or step ends.\par \par 300.3. When a phase ends (but not a step), any unused mana left in a player\rquote s mana pool is lost. That player loses 1 life for each one mana lost this way. This is called mana burn.

An ability is text on an object that\rquote s not reminder text or flavor text (see rule 400.1). The result of following such an instruction is an effect.

There are three general categories of abilities: activated, triggered, and static. Activated and triggered abilities can also be mana abilities.

An ability isn\rquote t a spell and therefore can\rquote t be countered by anything that counters only spells. Abilities can be countered by effects that specifically counter abilities, as well as by the rules (for example, an ability with one or more targets is countered if all its targets become illegal).\par \par 402.6. Once activated or triggered, an ability exists independently of its source as an ability on the stack. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won\rquote t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, \ldblquote Prodigal Sorcerer deals 1 damage to target creature or player\rdblquote ) rather than the ability doing anything directly.

An object may have multiple abilities. Aside from certain defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule 502, \ldblquote Keyword Abilities\rdblquote ), each paragraph break in a card\rquote s text marks a separate ability. An object may also have multiple instances of the same ability. Each instance functions independently.

Abilities function only while the permanent with the ability is in play unless the ability is a characteristic-setting ability that sets type or color, an ability of an instant or sorcery, an additional cost, an alternative cost, or a play restriction. Abilities can also function in other zones if they state otherwise or if the ability can only trigger or be played in a zone other than the in-play zone.

Then, if any new state-based effects have been generated, they resolve as a single event. This process repeats until no more applicable state-based effects are generated. Then triggered abilities are added to the stack (see rule 410, \ldblquote Handling Triggered Abilities\rdblquote ). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based effects or triggered abilities are generated.

No player gets priority during the untap step and players usually don\rquote t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 314.3).
