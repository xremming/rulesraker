# Rulesraker

Rulesraker aims to be an up-to-date source for the comprehensive rules of Magic: The Gathering. It does this by offering tooling to scrape the comprehensive rules from the official Wizards of the Coast website and store them in a structured format in this repository.

In addition to the current rules, a comprehensive archive of old rules is being gathered and maintained.

## Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the [pit142857/mtg-cr](https://github.com/pit142857/mtg-cr) repository which has documented a large number of new and old URLs of comprehensive rules documents.

[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) and its search has been incredibly valuable in finding old comprehensive rules documents.

Any and all additional help in finding and archiving old comprehensive rules documents is greatly appreciated. Please reach me over email at [maximilian@remming.fi](mailto:maximilian@remming.fi) if you have any information on old comprehensive rules documents.
